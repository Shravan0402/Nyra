Nyra â€“ Private Perpetuals Protocol

Nyra is a decentralized perpetuals protocol built to provide traders with private, low-cost leveraged trading while offering liquidity providers sustainable yield opportunities. The protocol combines efficient on-chain execution with privacy-focused infrastructure and robust risk management mechanisms.

> Key Features

Private Leveraged Trading
Open long or short positions on major assets with leverage, minimal gas costs, and strong privacy guarantees.

Liquidity Provider (LP) Vaults
LPs supply collateral to the system and earn yield through interest payments, trading fees, and funding rate flows.

Dynamic Interest Rates
Interest on borrowed funds adjusts based on market demand, rewarding LPs when utilization is high and lowering costs for traders when demand is low.

Funding Rate Mechanism
A peer-to-peer funding system aligns perpetual contract prices with the underlying spot market by balancing long and short demand.

Automated Liquidations
Under-collateralized positions are closed by permissionless liquidators, protecting system solvency. Liquidators are rewarded with fees, and a portion is directed to an insurance fund.

Protocol Security
Circuit breakers, oracle safeguards, and insurance reserves ensure market stability during volatility or anomalies.

ðŸ“ˆ Example Use Cases

Traders: Gain leveraged exposure to assets while preserving privacy.

Liquidity Providers: Earn yield by supplying stable collateral to the system.

Liquidators: Secure the protocol and earn incentives by closing risky positions.

ðŸ”’ Vision

Nyraâ€™s vision is to redefine perpetual trading by combining the efficiency of decentralized exchanges, the robustness of risk-managed leverage, and the privacy guarantees traders need in modern markets.

ðŸš€ Roadmap (High-Level)

Testnet Launch: Core contracts, isolated margin, basic funding + liquidation mechanisms.

Mainnet (Phase 1): BTC/ETH perps, LP vaults, automated liquidations.

Mainnet (Phase 2): Expanded assets, cross-margin, advanced order types, enhanced privacy layer.
