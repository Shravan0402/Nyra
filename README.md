Nyra: Private Perpetual Market on Horizen EVM

Nyra is a private perpetual market built on the Horizen EVM, designed to provide leveraged trading with robust privacy guarantees and minimal gas fees. By combining smart contracts with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Nyra enables institutions and individuals to trade perpetual futures, options, and indices without exposing sensitive strategies, balances, or transaction details.

🚀 Vision

Nyra aims to create a privacy-first perpetual market where:

Traders can open leveraged positions on multiple assets with strong privacy.

Liquidity Providers (LPs) supply collateral and earn interest or fees.

Automated Liquidators maintain market health by closing undercollateralized positions securely and privately.

This design ensures a secure, private, and efficient perpetual trading system.

>> Problem Statement

Most decentralized perpetual markets today:

Operate on public blockchains, revealing transaction data and strategies.

Lack institutional-grade privacy and scalability.

Struggle with advanced instruments like options due to computational overhead.

Nyra solves this by leveraging Horizen EVM with TEEs to keep trading encrypted, private, and scalable.

Asset Locking

Users lock assets in a Horizen smart contract.

TEE Event Listening

The TEE listens to smart contract events and maintains a balance Merkle tree.

TEE Public Key Fetching

Users fetch the TEE public key for encrypting trade details.

Encrypted Trade Submission

Users send encrypted trade data to the Horizen smart contract.

Private Execution

Trade details are decrypted and executed inside the TEE, ensuring confidentiality.

This architecture guarantees that no sensitive data is visible on-chain while preserving trust via TEE attestation.
